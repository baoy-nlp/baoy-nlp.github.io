# Yu Bao's Homepage

This is Yu Bao. My name in Chinese Pinyin has two interesting extensions, one means heavy rain (rainstorm) and the other means abalone (üêü). Actually, my name comes from "Staying together through thick and thin" because I also have an older brother named Feng Bao.

I have been working as a research scientist at ByteDance Research since Apr. 2022. Before that, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Nanjing University](https://grawww.nju.edu.cn/main.htm) in 2022. And I obtained a bachelor's degree from the School of Science of [Northeast Forestry University](https://www.nefu.edu.cn/) in 2015. <center><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?authuser=1&user=TqMb6nMAAAAJ">[Google Scholar]</a> <a href="mailto:nlp.baoy@gmail.com">[Email]</a> <a href="./files/baoy_CV.pdf">[CV]</a></center>

## Research Interest

As a researcher, I have broad research interests that are always changing. My research direction during my Ph.D. was in Natural Language Processing and Text Generation, focusing on exploring the application of deep generative models in structure or sequence modeling.

After joining ByteDance, I began to turn to the research of AI for Science and chose to explore structure-based drug design, committed to promoting (1) unified molecule generation and optimization modeling and (2) an efficient pipeline of drug molecule generation and optimization.
